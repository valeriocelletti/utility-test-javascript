# Weswit JavaScript Test Toolkit

This library offers simple testing facilities that can be exploited to run a series of synchronous and asynchronous tests. As an example, this library is used by the [Weswit JavaScript toolkit](https://github.com/weswit/utility-toolkit-javascript).

This library relies on the [Weswit JavaScript toolkit](https://github.com/weswit/utility-toolkit-javascript) and on the [Weswit JavaScript logging toolkit](https://github.com/weswit/utility-logging-javascript).
